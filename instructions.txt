Setup Mongodb and Node.js on your system.

(We can use Gitbash or command prompt for setting up)

We need to install certain things in order to connect to the local server(using following command)
npm install connect
npm install serve-static 

To work with the database, you first need to create a connecction

We will be using MongoDB's native Node.js driver to create the connection with MongoDB server.

We need to install following drivers in the express.js by using the command

npm install mongodb
npm install assert
npm install request
npm install express
npm install body-parser

After establishing the connection paste the URL in "My url is alive and I want to archive its content" and save the page.

Next paste the URL in "Archive for saved snapshots" and search we get require snapshot.

Currently only html files screen shots are being saved and not images and videos.
Multiple versions of the same URL are not being saved.
Old URL is being replaced but this can be implemented with the help of time stamps.
Querying using partial strings must be supported using maybe regex from mongodb.
